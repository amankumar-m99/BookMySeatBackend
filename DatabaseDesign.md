Designing a database for a movie ticket booking system involves several entities and relationships to ensure that the data can be managed efficiently. The primary goal is to store information about movies, theaters, showtimes, users, tickets, and payments.

Here’s a high-level database schema design for a movie ticket booking project:

### 1. **Entities and Tables**

1. **Users** (Customers)
   - Stores information about users who book tickets.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Users (
       user_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       first_name VARCHAR(255),
       last_name VARCHAR(255),
       phone_number VARCHAR(15),
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

2. **Movies**
   - Stores details about movies.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Movies (
       movie_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       description TEXT,
       genre VARCHAR(100),
       duration INT,  -- Duration in minutes
       language VARCHAR(100),
       release_date DATE,
       rating DECIMAL(3, 2), -- E.g. 8.7 for IMDB-like rating
       image_url VARCHAR(255) -- URL for poster/image
   );
   ```

3. **Theaters**
   - Stores information about theaters or cinema halls.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Theaters (
       theater_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       location VARCHAR(255),
       total_seats INT,
       contact_number VARCHAR(15),
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

4. **Screens**
   - A theater can have multiple screens (e.g., different halls or rooms showing different movies).

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Screens (
       screen_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       theater_id INT,
       screen_name VARCHAR(255),
       total_seats INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (theater_id) REFERENCES Theaters(theater_id)
   );
   ```

5. **Showtimes**
   - Stores the showtimes for each movie at different theaters/screens.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Showtimes (
       showtime_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       movie_id INT,
       screen_id INT,
       show_date DATE,
       show_time TIME,
       FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES Movies(movie_id),
       FOREIGN KEY (screen_id) REFERENCES Screens(screen_id)
   );
   ```

6. **Tickets**
   - Stores information about each ticket that a user books.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Tickets (
       ticket_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       user_id INT,
       showtime_id INT,
       num_of_seats INT,
       total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
       booking_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id),
       FOREIGN KEY (showtime_id) REFERENCES Showtimes(showtime_id)
   );
   ```

7. **Seats** (for tracking which seats are booked)
   - Tracks seat reservations within a specific showtime. A ticket can have multiple seats.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Seats (
       seat_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       showtime_id INT,
       seat_number VARCHAR(10),
       is_booked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
       FOREIGN KEY (showtime_id) REFERENCES Showtimes(showtime_id)
   );
   ```

8. **Payments**
   - Stores payment details for each ticket booking.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Payments (
       payment_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       ticket_id INT,
       payment_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
       payment_method VARCHAR(50), -- E.g., 'Credit Card', 'Debit Card', 'PayPal', etc.
       status VARCHAR(50), -- E.g., 'Completed', 'Pending', 'Failed'
       FOREIGN KEY (ticket_id) REFERENCES Tickets(ticket_id)
   );
   ```

### 2. **Relationships between Tables**

- **Users** and **Tickets**: A user can book multiple tickets.
- **Movies** and **Showtimes**: A movie can have multiple showtimes.
- **Theaters** and **Screens**: A theater can have multiple screens.
- **Showtimes** and **Seats**: A showtime can have multiple seats.
- **Tickets** and **Seats**: A ticket can have multiple seats assigned to it.

### 3. **Additional Considerations**

- **Indexes**: You may want to add indexes on frequently queried columns like `user_id` (for user’s booking history), `movie_id` (for movie search), `showtime_id` (for showing available seats), etc.
  
- **Seat Reservation Logic**: When a user books a ticket, ensure that seats are not double-booked. This can be handled through a transactional approach where a ticket and its seats are booked atomically.

- **Availability**: You might need a separate process or stored procedure to handle the availability of seats (whether they are free or reserved).

### 4. **Example Queries**

- **Get available showtimes for a movie:**

   ```sql
   SELECT s.showtime_id, t.name AS theater_name, sc.screen_name, s.show_date, s.show_time
   FROM Showtimes s
   JOIN Theaters t ON s.screen_id = t.theater_id
   JOIN Screens sc ON s.screen_id = sc.screen_id
   WHERE s.movie_id = 1 AND s.show_date >= CURDATE()
   ORDER BY s.show_date, s.show_time;
   ```

- **Get seats availability for a specific showtime:**

   ```sql
   SELECT seat_number, is_booked
   FROM Seats
   WHERE showtime_id = 1;
   ```

- **Get user's ticket booking history:**

   ```sql
   SELECT m.title, t.num_of_seats, t.total_amount, s.show_date, s.show_time
   FROM Tickets t
   JOIN Showtimes s ON t.showtime_id = s.showtime_id
   JOIN Movies m ON s.movie_id = m.movie_id
   WHERE t.user_id = 1
   ORDER BY t.booking_date DESC;
   ```

### 5. **Schema Diagram (Conceptual Overview)**

Here’s a conceptual overview of the relationships:

```
+----------+       +-----------+       +-----------+       +------------+
| Users    | 1---* | Tickets   | *---1 | Showtimes | 1---* | Movies     |
+----------+       +-----------+       +-----------+       +------------+
    |                   |                  |                   |
    *                   *                  *                   *
  +------------+       +-----------+      +-----------+       +------------+
  | Payments  | 1---* | Seats     |  *---1| Screens   |  1---*| Theaters   |
  +------------+       +-----------+      +-----------+       +------------+
```

### Conclusion
This schema provides a scalable and efficient way to handle movie ticket bookings. The main entities — **Users**, **Movies**, **Theaters**, **Showtimes**, **Seats**, **Tickets**, and **Payments** — are all connected in a way that supports key features like seat reservations, ticket bookings, and payment processing. As your project grows, you can enhance the schema with additional features, such as discounts, loyalty programs, or even ratings and reviews for movies.
